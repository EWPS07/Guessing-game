#Guessing game readme.

 The object of this guessing game will be to guess a color in the rainbow within 3 tries. A hint will be given after incorrect guesses.
 The color will be chosen at random. If the correct color is not guessed within the allowed 3 attempts, a message will be displayed stating that the guesses were wrong and then listing the correct answer.

 I started by defining variables to contain the user guess and the correct answer, as well as the hints and the guess-count,
 then created a 'while' loop to count each turn and check for a correct answer, if the guess was not correct it would provide the appropriate hint and promt the user to guess again.
